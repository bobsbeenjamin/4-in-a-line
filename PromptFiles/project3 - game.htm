<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Game</b>: <b>4-in-a-line</b></font></p>      
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">You have a 8x8 board, players take   
turns placing a piece on any grid. First player to get 4 in a line (either a   
row, or a column; diagonals are <b> NOT</b> counted) wins. The maximum amount of time   
allowed for generating the next move is 30 seconds. At the very beginning, your   
program should ask the user for the maximum amount time (in seconds)   
allowed for the computer to generate the answer and make sure that your search   
will stop when there's no time left. Your program should also ask the user to   
decide who is going to move first.</font></p>        
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In order to make the process    
smooth, you are <b>REQUIRED</b> to use the following standard in the movement that your program    
will generate:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Strategies and Other 
Requirements</b></font></p>      
<ol>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">To get a full credit, your  
    program must satisfy the requirements listed above, and <b> MUST</b> use <b>alpha-beta  
    pruning</b> to determine the computer's move. Note that, you will need to  
    make some changes to the alpha-beta pruning introduced in the book. These  
    changes include: an <i> evaluation function</i> so that you can evaluate  
    non-terminal states and a <i> cut-off test</i> to replace the terminal test so that  
    your program will return the best solution found so far given a specific  
    period of time.</font></li> 
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In general, you are allowed <font color="#FF0000">5  
    seconds </font>to run your algorithm, which should search at least 5 plies  
    deep. If you use languages other than C or C++, the number of plies may be  
    smaller.&nbsp;You can implement iterative deepening search with alpha-beta 
	pruning so that your program will search as deep as possible given the fixed 
	amount of time.</font></li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Given the same  
    amount of time, if your terminal evaluation function is simple, then your  
    program should be able to search deeper than one with a complex (but maybe  
    better) terminal evaluation function. You can decide whether you want a deeper  
    search and a simple evaluation, or a shallower search with a complex  
    evaluation.</font></li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Your program is one player,  
    and will attempt to defeat the human operator. Here, &quot;X&quot; means  
    &quot;computer&quot;, &quot;O&quot; means &quot;human&quot;.&nbsp;</font></li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"> The program  
    should detect when an illegal move has been entered and requires the human to  
    re-enter a valid move, for example, trying to place on a non-empty space, or 
    out of bounds.</font></li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Please refer to the 
	<a href="tictactoe.doc">tic-tac-toe.cc</a> 
    which implements MINIMAX as the base skeleton to develop the alpha-beta 
    pruning.</font></li>
</ol>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">A group of 2 is allowed to work on  
this project. You can also work individually. Your final executable program  
should be able to run on the computers in the CS labs. The top 3 or 4 teams will receive extra credits. 
All participants will earn participation credits.</font></p>      
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>How do two programs interact?</b></font></p>       
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">To make the interaction interface 
easy, your program should output what's the current choice for each step. Each 
program will run on one computer and the final result will be the opposite of 
each other. Please see the following illustration. Assume the opponent (the 
computer) moves first:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It depends on the number of groups

participation by Jun. 3rd.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Here's the strategy we used last time for small 
number of groups.</font></p>      
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Student teams will be arranged  
into group of 3. The 3 teams will play against each other in the same group.  
Each match contains two games, with each team moving first. A group will play a  
total of 6 games. A win counts as 1 point, a draw as .5, and a loss as 0 points.  
Within each group, whoever has the most points is the winner of the group.</font></p>       
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The next round will consist of 
winner teams from the first round and some 2nd place teams. This process will 
continue.</font></p>
