
Ideas:
	x Run 'complete' search, then store the real values of some intermediate states for our AI to search
	Try to create one of the following patterns with no opponent blockers:
		X X
		X
		
		X X
		
		X
	
Technologies:
	redis.io
	
ToDo:
	x PregameComputer
		createAllBoardsAtSingleDepth() 
			* Convert to be iterative rather than recursive
			* Store boards using better memory efficiency (currently using array of ints, which is 64x4=256 bytes)
			Check for rotated boards and prune away
			Check for wins and cut those branches
	* Find set of data structures that allow an easy traversal of the 'frontier'
	* After each depth, limit remaining searched branches by percentage
