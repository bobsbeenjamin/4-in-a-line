
Ideas:
	Run 'complete' search, then store the real values of some intermediate states for our AI to search
	Find set of data structures that allow an easy traversal of the 'frontier'
	Try to created the following pattern with no opponent blockers:
		x x
		x
	After each depth, limit remaining searched branches by percentage

		createAllBoardsAtSingleDepth() 
			Convert to be iterative rather than recursive
			Check for rotated boards and prune away
			Store boards using better memory efficiency (currently using array of ints, which is 64x4=256 bytes)
