4-in-a-line
===========

This plays an expanded version of Tic-Tac-Toe.
Play is done on an 8x8 board.
The only mode is human-vs-computer.
Only vertical and horizontal lines count as winning factors. Diagonal lines do not.
4 X's in a line means that X won, and the same is true for O's.
The computer player will take n seconds for each move throughout the game. n is set by the human user as the game starts.
